# Payments

### Payment Channels

There are various channels used to initiate transaction within the TPP platform.

### Make Payments

You can initiate payments to a collection. By selecting the payment channel, enter the required amount, and complete the payment process.

### Accept Payments

When someone pays you, the money goes into your account. It's simple! They choose how to pay, and we make sure it's real money. Then, we put the money in your account and tell you and the payer it worked.

### Block Payments

You can temporarily stop payments from happening by blocking them. This is useful if something is wrong with the system or there's a problem that needs fixing. When a payment is blocked, no one can send or receive money through that payment method until you unblock it. This helps keep your money safe.

### Test Payments

Before you start using our platform for real money transactions, you can practice with test payments. This means you can send and receive fake money to make sure everything works as expected. You can try different payment methods, check if your customers can pay correctly, and see how the money moves through the system. This helps you get comfortable with the platform and catch any problems before they affect real money.
