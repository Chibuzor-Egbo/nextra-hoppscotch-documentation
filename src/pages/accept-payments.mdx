# Accept Payments

<Callout type="info" emoji="🥜">
  <strong style={{ display: "block" }}>In a nutshell</strong>
  To accept a payment, create a transaction using our API, our client Javascript
  library, Popup JS, or our SDKs. Every transaction includes a link that can be used
  to complete payment.
</Callout>

## Popup

Paystack Popup is a Javascript library that allow developers to build a secure and convenient payment flow for their web applications. You can add it to your frontend application via CDN, NPM or Yarn:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @paystack/inline-js
```

If you used NPM or Yarn, ensure you import the library as shown below:

```js copy
import PaystackPop from "@paystack/inline-js";
```

With the library successfully installed, you can now begin the three-step integration process:

1. Initialize transaction
2. Complete transaction
3. Verify transaction status

### Initialize transaction

To get started, you need to initialize the transaction from your backend. Initializing the transaction from the backend ensures you have full control of the transaction details. To do this, make a POST request from your backend to the Initialize TransactionAPI endpoint:

<Tabs items={['cURL', 'Node', 'PHP']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    curl https://api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -d '{ "email": "customer@email.com", 
          "amount": "500000"
        }'
    -X POST
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```javascript
    const https = require('https')

    const params = JSON.stringify({
      "email": "customer@email.com",
      "amount": "500000"
    })

    const options = {
      hostname: 'api.paystack.co',
      port: 443,
      path: '/transaction/initialize',
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer SECRET_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    }

    const req = https.request(options, res => {
      let data = ''

      res.on('data', (chunk) => {
        data += chunk
      });

      res.on('end', () => {
        console.log(JSON.parse(data))
      })
    }).on('error', error => {
      console.error(error)
    })

    req.write(params)
    req.end()
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```php
    <?php
      $url = "https://api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize";

      $fields = [
        'email' => "customer@email.com",
        'amount' => "500000"
      ];

      $fields_string = http_build_query($fields);

      //open connection
      $ch = curl_init();

      //set the url, number of POST vars, POST data
      curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_URL, $url);
      curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_POST, true);
      curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fields_string);
      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
        "Authorization: Bearer SECRET_KEY",
        "Cache-Control: no-cache",
      ));

      //So that curl_exec returns the contents of the cURL; rather than echoing it
      curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

      //execute post
      $result = curl_exec($ch);
      echo $result;
    ?>
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The data object of the response contains an access_code parameter that is needed to complete the transaction. You should store this parameter and send it to your frontend.

<Callout>
  <strong style={{ display: "block" }}>
    Do not use your secret key in your frontend
  </strong>
  Never call the Paystack API directly from your frontend to avoid exposing your
  secret key on the frontend. All requests to the Paystack API should be initiated
  from your server, and your frontend gets the response from your server.
</Callout>

### Complete transaction

Your frontend application should make a request to your backend to initialize the transaction and get the access_code as described in the previous section. On getting the access_code from your backend, you can then use Popup to complete the transaction:

```js copy
const popup = new PaystackPop();
popup.resumeTransaction(access_code);
```

The resumeTransaction method triggers the checkout in the browser, allowing the user to choose their preferred payment channel to complete the transaction. You can check out the InlineJS reference guide to learn about the features available in Popup V2.

### Verify transaction status

Finally, you need to confirm the status of the transaction by using either webhooks or the verify transactions endpoint. Regardless of the method used, you need to use the following parameter to confirm if you should deliver value to your customer or not:

| Parameter                    | Description                                                                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <strong>data.status</strong> | This inidicates if the payment is successful or not                                             |
| <strong>data.amount</strong> | This indicates the price of your product or service in the lower denomination of your currency. |

<Callout>
  <strong style={{ display: "block" }}>Verify Amount</strong>
  When verifying the status of a transaction, you should also verify the amount to
  ensure it matches the value of the service you are delivering. If the amount doesn't
  match, do not deliver value to the customer.
</Callout>

## Redirect

Here, you call the Initialize TransactionAPI from your server to generate a checkout link, then redirect your users to the link so they can pay. After payment is made, the users are returned to your website at the callback_url

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  <strong style={{ display: "block" }}>Warning</strong>
  Confirm that your server can conclude a TLSv1.2 connection to Paystack's servers.
  Most up-to-date software have this capability. Contact your service provider for
  guidance if you have any SSL errors.
</Callout>

### Collect Customer Information

To initialize the transaction, you'll need to pass information such as email, first name, last name amount, transaction reference, etc. Email and amount are required. You can also pass any other additional information in the metadata object field.

The customer information can be retrieved from your database, session or cookie if you already have it stored, or from a form like in the example below.

```html filename="HTML" copy
<form action="/save-order-and-pay" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="user_email" value="<?php echo $email; ?>" />
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="<?php echo $amount; ?>" />
  <input type="hidden" name="cartid" value="<?php echo $cartid; ?>" />
  <button type="submit" name="pay_now" id="pay-now" title="Pay now">
    Pay now
  </button>
</form>
```

### Initialize Transaction

When a customer clicks the payment action button, initialize a transaction by making a POST request to our API. Pass the email, amount and any other parameters to the Initialize TransactionAPI endpoint.

If the API call is successful, we will return an authorization URL which you will redirect to for the customer to input their payment information to complete the transaction.

### Important notes

1. The amount should be in the subunit of the supported currency.
2. We used the cart_id from the form above as our transaction reference. You should use a unique transaction identifier from your system as your reference.
3. We set the callback_url in the transaction_data array. If you don't do this, we'll use the one that is set on your dashboard. Setting it in the code allows you to be flexible with the redirect URL if you need to
4. If you don't set a callback URL on the dashboard or on the code, the users will not be redirected back to your site after payment.
5. You can set test callback URLs for test transactions and live callback URLs for live transactions.

```php filename="PHP" copy

<?php
  $url = "https://api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize";

  $fields = [
    'email' => "customer@email.com",
    'amount' => "20000",
    'callback_url' => "https://hello.pstk.xyz/callback",
    'metadata' => ["cancel_action" => "https://your-cancel-url.com"]
  ];

  $fields_string = http_build_query($fields);

  //open connection
  $ch = curl_init();

  //set the url, number of POST vars, POST data
  curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_URL, $url);
  curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_POST, true);
  curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fields_string);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
    "Authorization: Bearer SECRET_KEY",
    "Cache-Control: no-cache",
  ));

  //So that curl_exec returns the contents of the cURL; rather than echoing it
  curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

  //execute post
  $result = curl_exec($ch);
  echo $result;
?>

```

### Verify Transaction

If the transaction is successful, Paystack will redirect the user back to a callback_url you set. We'll append the transaction reference in the URL. In the example above, the user will be redirected to http://your_website.com/postpayment_callback.php?reference=YOUR_REFERENCE.

So you retrieve the reference from the URL parameter and use that to call the verify endpoint to confirm the status of the transaction. Learn more about verifying transactions.

It's very important that you call the Verify endpoint to confirm the status of the transactions before delivering value. Just because the callback_url was visited doesn't prove that transaction was successful.

### Handle Webhook

When a payment is successful, Paystack sends a charge.success webhook event to webhook URL that you provide. Learn more about using webhooks.

## Mobile SDKs

With our mobile SDKs, we provide a collection of methods and interfaces tailored to the aesthetic of the platform. Transactions are initiated on the server and completed in the SDK. The SDK requires an access_code to display the UI component that accepts payment.

To get the access_code, you need to initialize a transaction by making a POST request on your server to the Initialize TransactionAPI endpoint:

On a successful initialization of the transaction, you get a response that contains an access_code. You need to return this access_code back to your mobile app.

<Callout>
  <strong style={{ display: "block" }}>Secret key safeguarding</strong>
  Do not make an API request to the Initialize Transaction endpoint directly on your
  mobile app because it requires your secret key. Your secret key should only be
  used on your server where stronger security measures can be put in place.
</Callout>

With the access_code in place, you can now use the SDKs to complete the transaction.

### Android SDK

You need to install the SDK by adding the paystack-ui dependency to the dependencies block of your app-level build.gradle file:

```js filename="build.gradle" copy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.paystack.android:paystack-ui:0.0.9'
}
```

With all the requirements for accepting payment now in place, you can initialize and use the SDK as shown below:

private lateinit var paymentSheet: PaymentSheet

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        // Other code snippets

            .setPublicKey("pk_test_xxxx")
            .build()
        paymentSheet = PaymentSheet(this, ::paymentComplete)

    }

    private fun makePayment() {
        // Pass access_code from transaction initialize call
        paymentSheet.launch("br6cgmvflhn3qtd")
    }


    private fun paymentComplete(paymentSheetResult: PaymentSheetResult) {
        val message = when (paymentSheetResult) {
            PaymentSheetResult.Cancelled -> "Cancelled"
            is PaymentSheetResult.Failed -> {
                Log.e("Something went wrong", paymentSheetResult.error.message.orEmpty(), paymentSheetResult.error)
                paymentSheetResult.error.message ?: "Failed"
            }

            is PaymentSheetResult.Completed -> {
                // Returns the transaction reference  PaymentCompletionDetails(reference={TransactionRef})
                Log.d("Payment successful", paymentSheetResult.paymentCompletionDetails.toString())
                "Successful"
            }
        }
    }
