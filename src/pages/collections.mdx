# Collections

Once youâ€™ve linked your bank account, you can start receiving payments by creating a collection. A collection is simply a way to gather payments from your customers.

## Creating Collections

To create a collection on TPP, log in and access the dashboard, then click to start a new collection. Enter the collection information, collection type, add clients, add settlement type and splits

#### Collection information

To create a successful collection on the TPP, providing clear and accurate information is crucial.

1. Collection Name: Choose a concise and descriptive name that accurately reflects the purpose of the collection. This helps both you and your payers easily identify the collection.
2. Collection Description: Provide a detailed explanation of what the collection is for. Clearly communicate the purpose of the collection, the expected amount, and any relevant deadlines or instructions.
3. Collection Purpose: Outline the specific reason for the collection. This information helps payers understand why they are making the payment and builds trust.

By providing comprehensive collection information, you enhance the overall payment experience for your customers and streamline the collection process.

#### Collection Type

The type of collection you create determines how payment amounts are set.

1. Dynamic collection: In a dynamic collection, payment amounts vary based on specific criteria. For example, school fees can be dynamic as different departments have different costs. Each payer will see the exact amount due based on their specific needs.
2. Static collection: A static collection has a fixed payment amount for all payers. This is suitable for situations where everyone pays the same amount, such as a membership fee.

#### Adding Clients to Collection

Adding clients to collections allows the collection owner to involve other clients in managing the collection. Clients can be given specific roles and permissions to help oversee the collection process. Each client is added using their unique ID and can access the collection based on the permissions granted.

#### Settlement Type

The way collected funds are distributed is determined by the settlement type. There are two primary options:

1. Single Account Settlement: All collected funds are consolidated into a single designated account.
2. Multiple Account Settlement: Funds are divided and transferred to multiple accounts based on predefined rules or percentages. This allows for distribution to owners, clients, or external partners

#### Splits

The split feature in TPP allows for the distribution of collected funds among multiple accounts. When setting up a collection, the owner can specify how the funds should be split among the linked accounts. Each account receives a percentage of the total collected amount, ensuring that all parties involved receive their share

## View Collections

Viewing a collection on TPP provides a comprehensive overview of the collection, including its name, description, purpose, and status (active or inactive). Users can see payment details like total amount collected and number of transactions, view a list of added clients with their roles, and check settlement information, including linked accounts and frequencies. Additionally, it offers reports and analytics for insights into performance, such as total revenue and transaction history. This functionality ensures efficient management and transparency of the collection.

## Collection Status

Collection status on TPP reflects the current state of a collection, indicating how it is being managed and accessed. The primary statuses are:

##### Active

The collection is fully operational and accepting payments. Invoices can be generated, and transactions are processed normally.

##### Pending

The collection has been created but is not yet active. It may require additional setup or approval before it starts accepting payments.

##### Suspended

The collection is temporarily paused and not accepting payments. This status may be used for maintenance or review purposes, and payments will resume once the collection is reactivated.

##### Blocked

The collection is inaccessible, and no payments can be processed. This status might indicate a serious issue or compliance problem that needs resolution before the collection can be reactivated.

## Invalidate Collection

You can stop a collection from receiving payments by invalidating it. Once invalidated, no one can pay into that collection anymore. This also means that all invoices linked to that collection become invalid and can't be paid. You might need to do this if you made a mistake in setting up the collection or if the collection's purpose is finished.
